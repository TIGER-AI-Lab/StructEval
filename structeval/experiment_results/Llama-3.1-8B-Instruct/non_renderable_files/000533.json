The newly discovered exoplanetary system consists of a terrestrial planet named Kepler-452b, a gas giant planet named Kepler-452c, and a small icy moon named Kepler-452d. The planet Kepler-452b was discovered in 2015 using the transit method. The planet's atmosphere consists of hydrogen, helium, and methane, and the atmospheric pressure is 100 kPa. The planet has a surface temperature of 20 C and a surface gravity of 9.8 m/s^2. The planet's moons include Kepler-452d, which has a diameter of 1000 km and an orbital period of 10 days. The features of Kepler-452d include a large crater and a volcano.
