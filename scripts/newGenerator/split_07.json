The SVG canvas must have a width of 400 pixels and a height of 300 pixels.\n2. The house's main body should be represented by a rectangle positioned centrally, with a width of 200 pixels and a height of 150 pixels.\n3. The rectangle representing the house body must be filled with a light yellow color using the hexadecimal code #FFFACD.\n4. A triangular roof should be drawn on top of the house body using a polygon element, with the base of the triangle aligned with the top edge of the rectangle, and the triangle filled with a firebrick red color (#B22222).\n5. The door should be a smaller rectangle centered horizontally on the lower half of the house body, with a width of 50 pixels and a height of 80 pixels, filled with a dark brown color using HEX #8B4513.\n6. Two square windows, each 40 pixels by 40 pixels, must be placed symmetrically on either side of the house, one on the left and one on the right of the door, both filled with a light blue color using hexadecimal #ADD8E6.\n7. All elements must have an outline stroke width of 2 pixels in black (#000000) to clearly define their shapes.\n8.

The house body should be a rectangle with a width of 200 pixels and a height of 150 pixels, centered horizontally and aligned with the bottom of the canvas, filled with light gray using the hexadecimal color #D3D3D3.\n3. The roof must be represented by a triangle (polygon) placed directly above the house body, with vertices aligned so that the base of the triangle matches the top edge of the house rectangle, and the triangle should be filled with maroon (#800000).\n4. Two square windows, each 40 pixels by 40 pixels, should be added to the house body—positioned symmetrically on either side of the center—with a fill color of sky blue (#87CEEB) and outlined with a 2-pixel stroke in dark gray (#A9A9A9).\n5. The door should be centered on the bottom of the house and represented as a rectangle with a width of 50 pixels and a height of 90 pixels, filled with brown (#8B4513)."

The house rectangle must be centered horizontally on a canvas that measures 400 pixels in both width and height.\n3.

The SVG should feature two square windows on the house’s body, each measuring 40 pixels in width and height, positioned symmetrically on either side of the house’s center.\n5. Both windows must be filled with light yellow (#FFFFE0) and outlined with a 2-pixel black stroke.\n6. A rectangular door should be centered horizontally at the bottom of the house’s body, measuring 40 pixels in width and 70 pixels in height, filled with dark gray (#A9A9A9).\n7. A small circle representing a doorknob should be placed on the right side of the door, with a radius of 5 pixels and filled with gold (#FFD700).\n8. All elements must be precisely positioned to ensure the house appears centered and grounded within the SVG canvas."

The SVG canvas must be 400 pixels wide and 400 pixels high.\n2. The house's body should be represented by a rectangle that is 200 pixels wide and 150 pixels tall, centered horizontally and positioned so that its bottom edge is 200 pixels from the top of the canvas.\n3. The house's body rectangle must be filled with a light blue color using the hexadecimal code #ADD8E6.\n4. The roof of the house should be created with a polygon element forming a triangle that sits directly on top of the house's body, filled with a dark red color using the hexadecimal code #8B0000.\n5. A circle representing the sun must be placed in the top-left corner with a radius of 40 pixels, filled with yellow (#FFD700) and outlined with a 3 pixel black stroke (#000000).\n6. A green field should be drawn as a rectangle covering the full width of the SVG (400 pixels) and a height of 50 pixels at the bottom of the canvas, filled with green (#008000).\n7. A window on the house should appear as a white rectangle measuring 50 pixels by 50 pixels, centered within the house's body and bordered with a 2 pixel solid black stroke.\n8. All elements must be positioned so that they are clearly visible and correctly aligned within the 400px by 400px SVG canvas."
